# FLUTTER HOME PAGE UI

This is a simple UI that i create as a progress for my Flutter Journey.
A Music Player Home page that implements material design, consists of white and blue color.

It's a static app, but i add some play button with stateful widget, so the button is kinda "playing" or "pause".

I'm a beginner you can help me or teach me for building a better apps.
